        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <p>I'm currently studying programming at Chattanooga State. I'm employed in Fiber Design at EPB. The first time I went to school, it was for drafting. While I enjoy my job, I'm bored. My partner and I have three dogs, I like playing video games, and I hate writing bios. I'm not a fan of small talk. So, I guess those are the things I'd want you to know about me. The dogs are pretty fun though, we have a great dane, a hound mutt, and a little terrier mutt with an underbite you could see from outer space.The hound has pretty severe general anxiety, which we give him Prozac for. I never thought I'd enter an "I have a dog on Prozac" phase, but here we are. He's a good boy though, and hopefully we'll be able to ween him off it with some training. We're both opposed to dog breeding, the great dane was given to Colin (the partner). She's actually the most well-behaved of the three, funny how that works.

        <h3>Why Programming?</h3>
        
        <p>I'm a creative person, and drafting just isn't the best outlet for that. I'd rather be creating, although I do love technical work and logical thinking. Programming seems a good extension of that. Side note to that, I'm *finally* getting the hang of the way this class is organized. I thought I had a good grip on things, but nope. Didn't. That's my bad, but I think it's gonna be fine now. Thanks for teaching! I know there are a million other ways you could use your skillset and time, so I appreciate it.
